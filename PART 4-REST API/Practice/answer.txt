1=> i dont know the difference between rest api and soap api

2=> we use HTTP methods to create and edit data.
  GET- is used to request or display data.
  POST- is used to send or input data.
  PUT - is used to update our data.
  DELETE - is used to remove our data.

3=> Query Parameters are gotten from the website url while path parameters are mostly gotten from the file system.

4=> I dont know  what idempotent mean.

5=>
  200 - The browser request is successful
  201 - Internet Problem with the browser.
  400 - Server response is successful.
  401 - Internal server error.
  403 - Internal server error.
  404 - Page not found.
  500 - Request successful.

6=> Because of the Chrome's V8 engine which uses Javascript.

7=> Middleware is used to control the workflow between API. it handles important functions like authentication.

8=>i dont know what are headers.

9=> Put is used to update a certain property in a data while Patch is used to update the whole data.

10=> Authentication is important in Apis cause it helps to restrict access to sensitive areas of the code.
  Examples are BetterAuth and OAuth.


~CORRECTION~

1> Rest api uses HTTP methods, returns data usually in Json, lightweight and faster
   while
   Soap api uses XML for requests, heavier and more strict, often used in banking systems.

3> Query parameters adds extra data in the url after ? often used for filtering or searching.
   while
   Path parameters are path of the url itself used to identify a resource.

4> Idempotent are methods whereby repeating the same request gives the same result e.g PUT,GET, DELETE.
  POST isnt idempotent because each call creates new data.

5> Status code:
  200 - Success (OK)
  201 - Created(new resource added succesfully)
  400 - bad request.
  401 -  Unauthorized(no valid authentication)
  403 - Forbidden(Valid Login but no permission)
  404 - not  found
  500 - Internal server error (server crashed or bug)

6> Json is lightweight and human readable.

8> Headers are extra functions sent with HTTP requests. Example: Content-Type: application/Json.

9> PUT replaces the entire resource with new data.
   PATCH modifies only specific fields.
   Example:
   User = {
    "name": "Stanley",
    "age": 25
   }

   PUT with {"name": "Mike"} ==> {"name": "Mike"}
   PATCH with {"name": "Mike"} ===> {"name": "Mike", "age": "25"};
